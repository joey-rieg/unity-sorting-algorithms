# Unity Sorting Algorithms

This project showcases various sorting algorithms with interactive visualizations, providing them as a Unity package for easy integration into your projects. It is designed for educational purposes, game mechanics, or simply exploring how different sorting algorithms work in real-time.

## What's included?
- [ ] **UPM Access**: Seamlessly import the package into any Unity project with UPM.
- [ ] **Interactive Visualizations**: Watch sorting algorithms step through their process with real-time animations.
- [ ] **Easy-to-Extend Framework**: Add custom sorting algorithms with minimal effort.
- [ ] **Step-by-Step Animations**: Pause and step through algorithms to see every operation in detail.

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms
### Comparison Sorts
- [ ] **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently sorts large datasets.
- [ ] **Bubble Sort**: A simple but inefficient sorting method for small datasets.
- [ ] **Insertion Sort**: Builds a sorted array one element at a time.
- [ ] **Merge Sort**: A stable and efficient algorithm using a divide-and-conquer approach.
- [ ] **Heap Sort**: Uses a binary heap data structure for efficient sorting.
- [ ] **Selection Sort**: A straightforward algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element.
- [ ] **... (more to come)**

### Non-Comparison Sorts
- [ ] **Bucket Sort**: Distributes elements into buckets for efficient sorting.
- [ ] **Counting Sort**: Works by counting the occurrences of each element.
- [ ] **Radix Sort**: Sorts numbers by processing individual digits.
- [ ] **... (more to come)**
